# MYSQL-Music-Store
The Music Store Analysis project uses MySQL to explore data from a music store, helping to understand customer preferences, sales trends, and artist performance. This project covers SQL concepts like querying, joins, aggregation, subqueries, and data manipulation to provide insights for better business decisions.

## Project Overview

In this analysis, I have addressed 11 questions, ranging from basic to advanced topics. For several questions, I have provided multiple solutions to demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem.
